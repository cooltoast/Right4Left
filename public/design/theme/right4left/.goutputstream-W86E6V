	   			It was a hot summer day. The air was sticky, it was 90 degrees outside, and there was no ice
cream truck in sight. It was a great day to be inside; a great day to be thankful for air conditioning.

Down 15-40, 3-4 in the first set, I tossed the ball to serve. The sun almost blinded me as I swung,
and the ball was in play. My opponent returned with a fierce cross court backhand. Quickly wiping the
sweat off my forehead, I lined up a Federer-esque inside out forehand down the line. The moment I hit
the shot, I knew I put him on the defense. He scrambled across the court for the ball, and I imagined I
was playing the likes of Rafael Nadal. Never have I felt such excitement and joy when he lobbed the ball.
It could not have been more perfect; I just sidestepped into position for my overhead. As I swung
through the ball, I felt some supernatural force assist me. I hit the ball in with such a great downward
velocity that it bounced once and went over the fence.
