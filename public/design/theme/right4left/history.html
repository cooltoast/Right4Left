			<h2>The History of Lefthandedness</h2>
				The left hand is often perceived as inferior. The Latin word for left, "sinistra", took the meanings of "evil" or "unlucky". The English language adopted the word as "sinister", meaning wicked and evil. However, the right hand has been linked with skill. The Latin word for right, "dexter", shows up in English as "dexterity", meaning agility and skill. Left-handedness can be obtained through rigorous use of the left hand for basic activities like writing, using utensils, etc. During infancy, a baby will favor one hand over the other. About 90% of the world's population is right handed. A left handed person can achieve everything a right handed person can. Some famous left handed individuals include Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, Isaac Newton, Pablo Picasso, Napoleon Bonaparte, Jimi Hendrix, and Leonardo da Vinci. Although none of them are alive, they have influenced history significantly. 
	There is no difference between the left side and the right side. Right handed people were either trained to be right handed by their parents or favored their right side for hereditary reasons. Information like speech production and language comprehension are localized differently in the brains of righties and lefties. This proves that the structure righties and lefties don't differ, but the cooperation of the left and right hemispheres of the brain differ. For example, a righty's ability to remember a language may be located in a different location than the same ability for a lefty. Further investigation is needed, but there is a possibility that the cohesiveness between a righty's brain hemispheres will change if he/she learns basic functions with the left hand. Alternatively, left handed people can experience this by using their right hands. Switching from your dominant to non dominant hand is difficult but possible.
