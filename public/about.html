	   			It was a hot summer day. The air was sticky, it was 90 degrees outside, and there was no ice
cream truck in sight. It was a great day to be inside; a great day to be thankful for air conditioning.	
</p>
<p>
Down 15-40, 3-4 in the first set, I tossed the ball to serve. The sun almost blinded me as I swung,
and the ball was in play. My opponent returned with a fierce cross court backhand. Quickly wiping the
sweat off my forehead, I lined up a Federer-esque inside out forehand down the line. The moment I hit
the shot, I knew I put him on the defense. He scrambled across the court for the ball, and I imagined I
was playing the likes of Rafael Nadal. Never have I felt such excitement and joy when he lobbed the ball.
It could not have been more perfect; I just sidestepped into position for my overhead. As I swung
through the ball, I felt some supernatural force assist me. I hit the ball in with such a great downward
velocity that it bounced once and went over the fence.
</p>
<p>
"It landed in those bushes, man. Go get it. These are new balls", said my opponent, who was
clearly upset.
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay fine", I replied reluctantly.
</p>
<p>
I walked outside to the bushes, and my opponent pointed to the ball with his racket from inside
the fence. It was stuck way inside the bush. I would have used my racket to get it, but it was my dad's
</p>
<p>
favorite racket, so I used my hand instead. I kneeled down and reached deep with my right arm to get
the ball. I could barely reach it, but I retrieved it and stood back up. I brushed myself off, and I went back
to the court to close out the match. I ended up losing the match.
</p>
<p>
A few days passed, and my right arm was getting red and itchy. Little red bumps emerged on my
forearm, elbow, wrist and triceps. I scratched those bumps like there was no tomorrow. Self-constraint
was never my forte. My whole arm was ravaged by poison ivy a few days later, and I had to wear a cast
to prevent scratching and aid healing.
</p>
<p>
Here's the kicker: this was not the first time this happened to me. When I was about 8, I was
doing yard work in the woods behind my grandfather's house. Long story short, I got a small poison ivy
rash on my right forearm. Since I scratched that rash so much, it spread and eventually consumed my
whole right arm. Like I said before, self-constraint is not my forte. I had to wear a cast, and I sat on the
sidelines, unable to play tennis for 2 months. They were the longest 2 months of my life.
</p>
<p>
Recalling this horrible memory, something triggered inside me. I told myself, I will play tennis,
no matter what it takes. My dad suggested we go out to the courts and I play him with my left hand.
</p>
<p>
And so I went to the court with a cast on my right arm and a racket in my left hand.
</p>
<p>
At first, like learning anything else, it was tough. I started from square one: learning the proper
grip, stance and basic strokes. Learning strokes was hard because I had no coordination and I was
quickly losing motivation. I would sometimes ask myself, what am I even doing here on the court? I
should be at home relaxing. I did my best to stick to a daily schedule.
</p>
<p>
From my standpoint, I didn't see improvement. But my numbers didn't lie. Over time, my
consistency and accuracy improved by almost 15%. To put this into perspective, if a recreational tennis
player's shots were 15% more consistent and accurate than normal, winners and aces would no longer
be rarities.
</p>
<p>
The summer after, I took a Neuroscience class at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Talented
Youth to learn about the brain and nervous system's role in learning left-handed tennis. I learnt about a
principal concept called Neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain and nervous system to adapt to changes
in the environment. Neuroplasticity in the human brain allows us to overcome any physical setbacks we
have. War veterans, tennis elbow victims, and even those with no self-constraint can benefit from the
Deliberate Practice Method.
</p>
<p>
From my viewpoint, learning left-handed tennis was very liberating. I no longer felt constrained
by outside influences and I had control over myself.
</p>
<p>
I continued on my left-handed tennis track long after my right arm healed. Right4Left.com is not
trying to prove that learning left-handed tennis can be done. That is obvious. Right4Left.com explains
how straightforward the whole process of learning left-handed tennis is. The Deliberate Practice
Method (DPM) is not limited to learning left-handed tennis, you can learn to use your left hand to throw, bowl, and even play golf. The options are endless. Right4Left.com has customized and simplified
the DPM for anyone to use.
</p>
<p>
Right4Left.com will take you step by step through the DPM process, and soon, you too can reap
the benefits of ambidexterity.
