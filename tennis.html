        <ol>
          <li>
            First, warm up by running around the court a few times. When you're done, start dynamic stretching. Compared
            to static stretching, which does not do much before exercise, dynamic stretching effectively lengthens and
            stretches your muscles prior to a workout.
          </li>

          <li>
            Pick a racquet grip that suits your style: eastern for power, western for spin, or semi-western for a
            balance. Before you start doing practice swings, you must learn the stance. All the power comes from the
            stance. For the forehand, there are two stances: open and closed.
          </li>

          <li>
            The open stance is more commonly used in the modern game, as it allows for more hip rotation and thus, more
            power. Practice open stances, keeping your right leg out front and supporting most of your weight on your
            left leg. Bend the knees slightly for stability. If you need to hit a low bounce, lower your torso by
            bending your knee, not your back.
          </li>

          <li>After learning the stance, then you can learn the basic swing.</li>

          <li>
            In stage 1, the player positions himself to hit the ball with an open stance. Using this stance, he first
            brings his racquet back. In stage 2, he starts his swing. Leading with his shoulder, he brings the racquet
            down to the ball. The stroke should be from low to high. In stage 3, he makes contact with the ball while
            keeping his eyes on the ball. In stage 4, he brings the racquet up and over his opposite shoulder to follow
            through. In stage 5, he decelerates his racquet by following through.
          </li>

          <li>
            The low to high stroke naturally creates topspin, which, by Bernoulli's principle and the Magnus effect,
            helps the ball arc over the net and into the court. Topspin helps powerful shots bounce in the court without
            sacrificing the ball's velocity.
          </li>

          <li>
            Once you've mastered the forehand stroke mechanics, try it out on the court. Hit 100 forehands, and count
            how many land in the court. Record this percentage, as it is your starting point from which you may improve
            as you practice. If possible, hit 100 shots with your dominant hand afterwards (as a control variable), and
            record the percentage; it will give your non-dominant data some perspective. Over several weeks, you can
            compare your non-dominant and dominant forehand percentages.
